# Test Documentation

This document describes the test coverage for the Goverse distributed system framework.

## Test Coverage Summary

The project now includes comprehensive unit tests for the core library packages:

### Utility Packages (100% coverage)
- **util/logger** - Logger functionality with configurable log levels
- **util/uniqueid** - Unique ID generation with timestamp and random components

### Core Library Packages

#### object Package (100% coverage)
Tests for the base object implementation that all distributed objects inherit from:
- ID generation and management
- Object type identification
- String representation
- Logger initialization
- Proto message handling

#### client Package (100% coverage)
Tests for the client base functionality:
- Message channel creation and management
- Client object interface implementation
- ID and type management
- Message passing capabilities

#### cluster Package (90% coverage)
Tests for the cluster singleton management:
- Singleton pattern verification
- Node registration and retrieval
- Error handling for uninitialized state
- Duplicate node prevention

#### server Package (12.4% coverage)
Tests for server configuration and validation:
- Configuration validation (nil, empty fields)
- Server initialization
- Logger and node setup

#### goverseapi Package (20% coverage)
Tests for the API wrapper functions:
- Server creation
- Type alias verification
- API surface validation

## Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
go test -cover ./...
```

Run tests for a specific package:
```bash
go test -v ./object/...
go test -v ./cluster/...
go test -v ./client/...
```

Run tests with detailed coverage report:
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

## Test Philosophy

The tests follow these principles:
1. **Simple and Focused** - Each test validates a specific behavior
2. **Useful** - Tests validate real functionality that users depend on
3. **Fast** - All tests run quickly without external dependencies
4. **Isolated** - Tests don't require external services (inspector, databases, etc.)
5. **Comprehensive** - Edge cases and error conditions are tested

## Test Structure

Each test file follows the naming convention `<package>_test.go` and includes:
- Basic functionality tests
- Edge case tests
- Error condition tests
- Interface compliance tests
- Integration tests where appropriate

## Areas Not Tested

The following areas are intentionally not tested due to complexity or external dependencies:
- **node Package** - Requires gRPC connections to inspector service
- **server Package (full)** - Requires actual server startup and networking
- **cmd/inspector** - Command-line tool, requires end-to-end testing
- **samples** - Sample applications, tested manually or via integration tests

These components would benefit from integration tests rather than unit tests.

## Future Test Improvements

Potential areas for additional test coverage:
1. Integration tests for the full client-server interaction
2. Mock-based tests for node package without requiring inspector
3. Performance benchmarks for message passing
4. Stress tests for concurrent object creation
5. End-to-end tests for the sample chat application

## Contributing Tests

When adding new functionality, please include tests that:
- Are simple to understand and maintain
- Test the public API surface
- Handle edge cases and errors
- Don't require complex setup or external services
